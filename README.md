# Driving-Car-Using-Js
this project is done by using Html, Css, Javascript.
you can do it just by using Html & Css as i've mentioned the documentation what you should change to just work but only thing you'll miss is 
you wont be able to control it(no functionality can be faced ) so to do this i've used javascript jquery objective
just delete the js code and remove the commentry tag in css called: 'animation' activate that and see boom everything working fine without 
the control.
